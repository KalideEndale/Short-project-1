Does Time magazine have a bias towards Men for cover pages?


QUICK INTRO:
I pulled this dataset from Kaggle. My dataset is a record of all the appearances that were made by bothmale(variable 3) and female(variable 2) personalities for the cover of Time Magazine from 1923(when Timemagazine was founded) to 2013(variable 1). The Time is a popular American news magazine publishingcompany that is famous for its magazines which were published weekly and as of 2020 published bi-weekly.According to a 2012 statistic, Time had a circulation of 3.3 million, making it the second-most circulatedmagazine behind “People” magazine. I choose this dataset to see if Time magazine has any gender-specificbias when choosing personalities for their cover pages. Additionally, I wanted to see if a bias exists, arethese biases being exacerbated or is Time magazine making an effort to uphold equality in their selectionprocess? As stewards of a very popular magazine, the role Time magazine has in shaping our perceptionand culture is immense so it’s profoundly important for this institution to practice equality in its selectionprocess. Additionally, these cover pages are also snapshots of American news makers so this dataset couldlend us a window into analyzing American culture moments.
